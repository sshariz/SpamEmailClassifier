    "Logistic Regression if a model problem in classification which involves predicting a categorical variable: such as is it spam or not - yes or no. A classification model aims to categorize data (binary or multiclass). In **binary classification** data must belong to one of two groups, it can be extended to more in the multi-class case. \n",

    "In observing the outcomes of a coin flip (1=Heads, 0=Tails). If we had 10 flips = [0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] for the next flip would you predict Heads or Tails? In a reasonable model we assume all flips are iid - independent & identically distributed. As in, each flip has the same probability of returning a Heads. \n",

    "If we define a parameter theta, the probability the next flip is Heads, we use this parameter theta to inform our decision for yhat, or our 0-1 prediction of the next flip. \n"

    "#### Evaluating the Classifier\n",

    "Thinking about the intention and applications of our problem: identifying spam emails, and likely to **filter an inbox** so that we prevent a `spam` email from going to the inbox folder. Remember, we are classifying spam as 1 and ham as 0. There are two kinds of errors we can make:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `False Positive (FP):` a real email gets flagged as spam and filtered out of the inbox\n",
    "* `False Negative (FN):` a spam email gets mislabeled as real and ends up in the inbox\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, it's more important to optimize for minimizing for False Positives, because it is more \"deadly\" to lose a real email to the spam folder than it is to be exposed to a spam email by accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision**: Measures the proportion $\\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FP}}$ of emails flagged as spam that are actually spam.\n",

Otherwise, if the feature can take on many values, it makes sense to compare the distribution under spam to the distribution under ham. Create a class conditional density plot like the one below (which was created using sns.distplot), comparing the distribution of a feature among all spam emails to the distribution of the same feature among all ham emails. You may use the Fraction of Uppercase Letters or create your own feature."
